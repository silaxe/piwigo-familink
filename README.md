# 📸 Piwigo Familink Prints Plugin

A lightweight plugin for **Piwigo** that allows users to order photo prints directly from their private galleries and send them via the **Familink** service.

- 🖼️ Select print formats (10x15 cm, 15x20 cm)  
- 🔢 Adjust quantities directly in the cart  
- 🧾 Simple checkout form with delivery address  
- 🎨 Choose print finish (e.g. glossy)  
- 🔐 Secure temporary URLs for image transfer  
- 📦 Server-side order processing  
- 🧹 Empty cart functionality

## 🧩 How it works

The plugin is built around a simple 3-step architecture:

1. **Piwigo Plugin Layer**
   - Adds UI elements (cart, buttons, checkout)
   - Stores selected photos in a database table

2. **Bridge Layer**
   - Generates secure, temporary URLs to access original images
   - Ensures controlled external access

3. **Order Processing**
   - Sends selected images and user data to the Familink API
   - Handles sandbox or production modes

---

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Copy the plugin folder into your Piwigo installation:

```
plugins/familink_prints/
```

2. Activate the plugin from the Piwigo admin panel

3. Configure:
   - Familink API key
   - Sandbox mode (recommended for testing)

---

## 🔧 Configuration

The plugin provides an admin interface to:

- Set your **Familink API key**
- Enable/disable **sandbox mode**

---

## 🧪 Sandbox vs Production

- **Sandbox mode**:  
  - No real prints are sent  
  - Useful for testing and development
